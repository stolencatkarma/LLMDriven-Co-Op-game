An Adventure for a Generic D20 System

The Blackout Protocol
A Mercenary Adventure for a Generic D20 System

Introduction for the Game Master (GM)
This adventure is designed for a generic d20 system and can be adapted to your preferred ruleset. It places the player characters (PCs) in the roles of skilled mercenaries hired for a high-stakes mission within a sprawling mega-city. The core conflict revolves around a race against time to retrieve vital maintenance parts to prevent a catastrophic power failure in a significant sector of the city. The GM should be prepared to improvise and adapt the challenges based on the players' actions and skillsets.

Adventure Synopsis
The PCs, a team of seasoned mercenaries, are summoned to the gleaming towers of Neo-Alexandria's central district. They are hired by the city's chief engineer to venture into the long-abandoned and treacherous "Lower Sector" to retrieve a specific set of "Cascade Regulators." These components are critical to repairing the city's aging power grid. Without them, the "Serenity District," a bustling residential and commercial hub, will be plunged into darkness, leading to widespread chaos, looting, and a potential breakdown of social order. The journey will test their combat prowess, technical skills, and ability to navigate a hazardous urban environment.

The Setting: Neo-Alexandria
Neo-Alexandria is a vertical metropolis, a city of towering skyscrapers that pierce the clouds, interconnected by sky-bridges and crisscrossed by flying vehicles. Below this glittering facade lies the Lower Sector, a relic of the city's past. Decades of neglect have transformed it into a dangerous, labyrinthine environment. Its narrow, shadowed streets are choked with debris, and its buildings are skeletal remains of a bygone era. The air is thick with pollutants, and rogue automated security systems still patrol some areas. The Lower Sector is also home to desperate scavengers and mutated creatures that have adapted to the harsh conditions.

The Mission Briefing
The adventure begins when the PCs are contacted by a representative of Anya Sharma, the pragmatic and no-nonsense chief engineer of Neo-Alexandria's power infrastructure. They are offered a substantial sum of credits to undertake this urgent mission.

Anya will meet them in her pristine, high-tech office overlooking the city. She will explain the situation:

"A critical failure is imminent in the Serenity District's power substation. The primary and backup systems are failing. The only compatible replacement parts, a set of Cascade Regulators, are located in the old 'Sector-7G' power station in the Lower Sector. That area was sealed off decades ago after a containment breach. We've lost all remote access and the entire sector is...unpredictable. You will be provided with a schematic of the old power station and the specific location of the regulators. You have 24 hours. If you don't return with those parts, the Serenity District goes dark. The consequences will be... severe."

Anya will provide the following:

A data slate with a map of the most direct route to Sector-7G.
The schematics for the power station, highlighting the location of the Cascade Regulators.
A requisition for basic supplies (med-kits, rations, ammunition) from the city armory.
The Journey to the Lower Sector
The descent into the Lower Sector is the first challenge. The PCs can choose their method of entry, each with its own risks:

The Service Elevator: A massive, rickety freight elevator. It is the most direct route but is prone to mechanical failures. A DC 15 Mechanics or Engineering check might be required to keep it operational. A failure could result in the elevator becoming stuck, forcing a perilous climb.
The Collapsed Skyway: A series of collapsed and unstable sky-bridges offer a more stealthy approach. This route requires a series of DC 14 Acrobatics or Athletics checks to navigate the treacherous gaps and crumbling structures.
The Sewer Tunnels: A network of dark, foul-smelling tunnels. This route offers cover but is home to mutated vermin and pockets of toxic gas. A DC 13 Perception or Survival check is needed to avoid ambushes and environmental hazards.
Encounter: The Vultures

Regardless of their route, the PCs will attract the attention of "The Vultures," a ruthless scavenger gang that preys on those who venture into the Lower Sector. Their leader, a cunning and brutal individual named Rook, sees the well-equipped PCs as a prime target.

This encounter can be a firefight in the narrow streets, a tense standoff on a precarious ledge, or a chase through the decaying urban landscape. The Vultures will use their knowledge of the terrain to their advantage, setting up ambushes and traps.

Sector-7G Power Station
The power station is a hulking, brutalist structure, eerily silent save for the hum of emergency lighting in some areas. The main entrance is sealed, forcing the PCs to find an alternative way in.

Possible entry points:

A collapsed wall: Requiring a DC 12 Strength or Athletics check to clear the debris.
A rooftop maintenance hatch: Accessible via a perilous climb up the exterior of the building (DC 14 Athletics check).
An underwater coolant pipe: A risky option that requires a DC 15 Constitution or Endurance check to withstand the cold and contaminated water.
Inside the Power Station:

The interior is a maze of catwalks, machinery, and darkened corridors. The air is thick with the smell of ozone and decay.

Challenges:

Automated Security: While most systems are offline, some automated turrets and security drones may still be active. These can be disabled with a DC 16 Electronics or Security Systems check or destroyed through combat.
Environmental Hazards: Leaking coolant creates slippery surfaces (DC 12 Acrobatics or Dexterity check to avoid falling). Exposed electrical conduits spark intermittently, requiring a DC 14 Perception check to spot and avoid.
The Lair: The storage room containing the Cascade Regulators has become the lair of a "Volt-Geist," a mutated creature that feeds on electrical energy. It is a territorial and highly aggressive beast that can discharge powerful electrical shocks.
Climax: Retrieving the Regulators

The Cascade Regulators are housed in a heavily shielded container. Opening it requires a DC 18 Mechanics or Engineering check. A failed check could damage the delicate components. The noise of their activity will likely attract the Volt-Geist if it hasn't been dealt with already.

The fight with the Volt-Geist should be a challenging encounter. It will use the environment to its advantage, clinging to ceilings and zipping through conduits.

The Return Journey and Conclusion
Once the PCs have the regulators, they must make their way back to the surface. They may have to contend with the remaining Vultures who might be seeking revenge. The journey back is a race against the clock.

Success:

If the PCs return with the Cascade Regulators within the 24-hour time limit, Anya Sharma will be immensely relieved. She will pay them the agreed-upon sum and may offer them a bonus for their efficiency. The Serenity District's lights will flicker but hold, and the PCs will have earned a reputation as reliable and effective operatives. They may also gain a valuable contact in Anya.

Partial Success:

If the PCs return late, but with the parts, some sections of the Serenity District may have already lost power, leading to localized rioting and looting. Anya will still pay them, but the bonus will be off the table. Their reputation will be that of mercenaries who get the job done, but not without complications.

Failure:

If the PCs fail to retrieve the regulators, the Serenity District is plunged into darkness. The resulting chaos will be widespread and violent. Anya Sharma will be furious and will likely blacklist the PCs from any future contracts. They will have made a powerful enemy and will have to live with the consequences of their failure. The adventure could then shift to dealing with the fallout of the blackout.
