Adventure Example 5: The Ghost in the Machine (Hacking)
This adventure is designed to teach an LLM how to run a tense, non-combat infiltration scenario focused on hacking, data theft, and digital traps. It is best placed during Part 3: The Elysian Echo, when the PCs need to acquire sensitive information or sabotage Aethel's systems.

Prerequisites: At least one PC has skills related to hacking, computer use, or electronics. The party has identified a target: a local Aethel Corp. "Data Nexus," a hardened server farm that processes surveillance and logistical data for a Hab-Block sector.

The Hook: The Echoes need to know where Aethel is moving key personnel or supplies in preparation for the coming crackdown. This intelligence is stored on the Data Nexus servers, but it's protected by a formidable AI security program known as a "Cerberus." The PCs must physically infiltrate the facility to gain a hardline connection and then digitally breach the system.

Core GMing Concepts for the LLM:

Abstracting Hacking: Hacking is not just one roll. It's a sequence of challenges representing firewalls, Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics (ICE), and data encryption.
Information as a Reward: The goal isn't just to "win," but to acquire specific pieces of data. Success is measured by what you learn.
Digital Threats & Consequences: Failure doesn't mean a game over screen. It means the system's security AI becomes aware, tracing the hacker, locking them out, or even triggering physical alarms.
Team-Based Hacking: While one player hacks, the others have crucial support roles.
Key Scenes & GMing Focus:

The Physical Infiltration: The Data Nexus is a sterile, heavily automated facility. The first challenge is getting to a terminal without raising a physical alarm. This might involve:

Bypassing electronic door locks (Electronics skill).
Avoiding camera and motion sensor patrols (Stealth skill).
Creating a diversion in another part of the Hab-Block to draw Warden patrols away (Streetwise or Persuasion skill).
LLM Focus: The LLM needs to manage the roles of the entire team. The "muscle" provides lookout, the "face" might have created the diversion, while the "hacker" prepares their gear. This teaches the LLM to keep all players engaged during a specialized mission.
Jacking In: The Digital Gauntlet: Once the hacker connects their rig to a server port, the LLM switches to describing the digital landscape.

GM Narration: "You bypass the physical interface and your consciousness plunges into the digital realm of the Aethel network. It's not chaos; it's a pristine, orderly grid of light. Data flows in perfect, glowing lines. In the distance, you see the data vault you need—a pulsating cube of golden light. But between you and it are several shimmering walls of energy—the firewalls. And patrolling the grid is a predatory program, a three-headed construct of jagged black code—the Cerberus ICE. It hasn't seen you... yet."
LLM Focus: The LLM should present the hack as a series of obstacles.
Obstacle 1: The First Firewall (Access Code). This is a simple barrier. The hacker needs to make a Hacking skill check to brute-force a password or exploit a known vulnerability. On a failure, the Cerberus AI's "awareness" level increases by one.
Obstacle 2: The "Tar Pit" ICE (Data Scrubber). This is a defensive program. A failed Hacking check here doesn't just alert the Cerberus; it attempts to wipe the hacker's own console. The hacker must make a secondary check to protect their gear.
Obstacle 3: The Cerberus Hunt. Once the Cerberus's awareness reaches a certain threshold (e.g., 3), it actively begins hunting the hacker. This initiates a digital cat-and-mouse game. The LLM narrates the Cerberus trying to locate the hacker's digital signature. The hacker must make opposed Hacking checks against the AI's security rating to remain hidden while they work. This is where the tension escalates dramatically.
Support Roles: The other PCs are not idle during the hack.

LLM Focus: The LLM should prompt the other players for their actions. Can the team's mechanic try to reroute power in the facility to cause a system glitch, giving the hacker an advantage on their next roll? Can the lookout spot an incoming Warden patrol, forcing the hacker to work faster? This teaches the LLM to cut between scenes and maintain group involvement.
Climax and Resolution:

The hacker reaches the data vault and must make a final, difficult Hacking check to download the files.

Critical Success: They get the files and can even plant a "backdoor" for future access or delete the logs of their intrusion.
Success: They get the files but the Cerberus knows exactly who they are, and physical alarms are blaring. The mission now becomes a desperate escape.
Failure: They are locked out of the system, and their physical location is broadcast to every Warden in the sector. The team must abandon the mission and flee for their lives.
This adventure teaches the LLM to create suspense and challenge without resorting to physical combat. It highlights the power of information as a reward and demonstrates how a complex task can be broken down into a series of engaging, skill-based steps for the whole party.
