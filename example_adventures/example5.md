Mission Dossier: A Guide to Operations in the Wastes
Here are fleshed-out descriptions for a variety of mission types perfect for any roleplaying game set in a post-apocalyptic or sci-fi wasteland. These templates provide a framework for creating compelling adventures, complete with objectives, potential complications, and narrative hooks to draw your players into the world.

Scavenger Mission
Core Concept: Beyond a simple shopping trip, a scavenger mission is a desperate hunt for specific resources, components, or artifacts in a dangerous and unforgiving environment. The focus is on exploration, discovery, and overcoming the obstacles guarding valuable salvage.

Description: The lifeblood of any settlement is the steady flow of salvage from the ruins of the old world. Scavenger missions are the backbone of this fragile economy. These aren't idle treasure hunts; they are targeted operations to recover specific items of critical importance. A water purifier might need a new filter, a mechanic might require a particular set of pre-Collapse power tools, or a historian might offer a handsome reward for a functional data slate from a bygone era. The challenges lie not only in locating the target but also in dealing with the dangers that have claimed it as their own: rival crews, mutated beasts, treacherous terrain, and the lingering ghosts of the past.

Primary Objectives:

Locate the designated salvage area.
Find and secure the specified item(s).
Return the salvage to the quest giver.
Potential Complications & Twists:

Rival Scavengers: Another crew is after the same prize, leading to a tense standoff, a frantic race, or open conflict.
Unexpected Guardians: The salvage is located in the den of a dangerous creature or the heart of a hostile community.
Environmental Hazards: The location is irradiated, structurally unstable, or prone to sudden, violent weather phenomena.
The "Matryoshka" Cache: The initial prize is just one part of a larger, more valuable discovery, tempting the scavengers to press their luck.
Moral Dilemma: The "salvage" is currently in use by a struggling community that will be doomed without it.
Bounty Mission
Core Concept: A bounty mission is the targeted acquisition of a person or creature, dead or alive, for a set price. These missions are often fraught with moral ambiguity and require a combination of tracking, combat, and negotiation skills.

Description: In a lawless world, justice is often a commodity. Bounty missions are put out on individuals or creatures deemed a threat or a nuisance. The targets can range from notorious raider warlords and escaped prisoners to rogue synthetics and particularly troublesome mutated beasts. The reasons for the bounty can be as varied as the targets themselves: a settlement seeking retribution, a powerful figure wanting an enemy eliminated, or a corporation looking to retrieve "stolen property." Hunters must be prepared to face not only their target but also their target's allies, traps, and the ethical implications of their work.

Primary Objectives:

Track and locate the target.
Capture or eliminate the target as per the bounty's conditions.
Provide proof of the completed bounty to the issuer.
Potential Complications & Twists:

The Wrong Target: The bounty information is inaccurate, and the target is not who they seem.
A Change of Heart: The target offers the bounty hunters a better deal or a compelling reason to spare them.
The Hunter Becomes the Hunted: A rival bounty hunter is after the same target and is willing to eliminate the competition.
Extenuating Circumstances: The "villain" is protecting a community or has a justifiable reason for their actions.
The "Dead or Alive" Dilemma: Bringing the target in alive is significantly more difficult but may yield a greater reward or crucial information.
Fetch Quest
Core Concept: A classic for a reason, the fetch quest involves retrieving a specific item for a client. The key to making a fetch quest compelling lies in the journey and the story surrounding the object.

Description: At its heart, a fetch quest is a mission of retrieval. Someone needs something they cannot get themselves, and they are willing to pay for its acquisition. The "what" can be anything: a rare medicinal herb from a treacherous mountain pass, a lost family heirloom from a forgotten bunker, a data chip with vital information from a corporate ruin, or even a specific bottle of pre-Collapse vintage for a wealthy connoisseur. The value is often in the eye of the beholder, but the journey to obtain it is always an adventure.

Primary Objectives:

Travel to the location of the desired item.
Acquire the item.
Return the item to the client.
Potential Complications & Twists:

The Item is Not as Described: The "heirloom" is a dangerous piece of technology, or the "medicinal herb" has potent, unforeseen side effects.
A "Simple" Task Becomes Complicated: The item is guarded by a powerful entity, or its retrieval triggers an ancient security system.
The Double-Cross: The client has no intention of paying and plans to take the item by force upon the party's return.
Multiple Claimants: Someone else believes they have a rightful claim to the item and will stop at nothing to get it.
The Journey is the Destination: The real purpose of the quest was not the item itself, but to get the party to a specific location or to test their abilities.
Varmint Hunting
Core Concept: While seemingly mundane, a varmint hunting mission can quickly escalate from simple pest control to a terrifying encounter with the unnatural.

Description: The wasteland is teeming with creatures that have adapted and thrived in the ruins of civilization. While some are merely a nuisance, others pose a significant threat to settlements and their resources. Varmint hunting missions task the party with culling the numbers of these creatures. This could involve clearing a pack of mutated hounds from a trade route, eradicating a nest of giant insects from a farmstead, or dealing with a particularly aggressive flock of irradiated avians. What starts as a straightforward extermination can quickly become a desperate fight for survival when the "varmints" are more intelligent, numerous, or dangerous than initially believed.

Primary Objectives:

Travel to the designated area.
Eliminate the specified number or type of creatures.
(Optional) Collect a trophy or proof of the kill.
Potential Complications & Twists:

The "Varmints" Are Not What They Seem: The creatures are intelligent and organized, or they are the young of a much larger, more powerful beast.
A Symptom of a Greater Problem: The varmints are being driven from their natural habitat by a more significant threat.
Unexpected Environmental Dangers: The creatures' lair is in a hazardous location, such as a toxic waste dump or a structurally unsound building.
The Food Chain Reacts: Eliminating one type of creature attracts a new, even more dangerous predator to the area.
Moral Quandary: The "pests" are a vital part of the local ecosystem, and their removal will have unforeseen and devastating consequences.
Scouting the Wasteland
Core Concept: These missions are all about exploration and information gathering. The goal is not to conquer a location but to survey it, identify threats and resources, and return with valuable intelligence.

Description: Knowledge is power in the wasteland. Scouting missions are commissioned by factions, settlements, or explorers who need to understand the ever-changing landscape. The party might be tasked with charting a new, safer trade route; assessing the strength and disposition of a rival group; investigating a strange energy signature; or simply mapping an uncharted territory. Success is measured not in kills or loot, but in the quality and accuracy of the information brought back. The dangers are many, from environmental hazards and hostile encounters to the simple, stark reality of getting lost in the vast, unforgiving wilderness.

Primary Objectives:

Travel to and survey the designated area.
Gather specific information (e.g., enemy numbers, resource locations, safe passages).
Avoid detection and unnecessary conflict.
Return with a detailed report.
Potential Complications & Twists:

The Map is Wrong: The provided maps are outdated or deliberately misleading.
Discovery of Something Unexpected: The scouting mission uncovers a hidden threat, a valuable resource not on the manifest, or a secret that someone will kill to protect.
Being Watched: The party is being observed by an unknown entity, leading to a tense cat-and-mouse game.
A Cry for Help: The scouts stumble upon a situation that demands their intervention, forcing them to choose between their mission and their morals.
No Easy Way Back: The route back is blocked, forcing the party to find an alternative, more dangerous path.
Technological Undercity
Core Concept: Delving into the technological remnants of the past, these missions take place in vast, subterranean complexes, automated factories, or the bowels of derelict arcologies. The challenges are a mix of technological puzzles, reactivated security systems, and encounters with entities that have evolved in the darkness.

Description: Beneath the dust and decay of the surface world lie the technological marvels and horrors of a bygone age. Missions into the Technological Undercity send the party into these sprawling, artificial environments. They might be searching for a functioning power core, a lost piece of advanced technology, a way to reboot a dormant system, or the truth behind a pre-Collapse experiment gone wrong. These subterranean worlds are often a labyrinth of malfunctioning security drones, rogue AI, mutated former inhabitants, and complex environmental puzzles that require both brains and brawn to overcome. The very air can be hostile, and the silence is often broken by the hum of ancient machinery and the scuttling of unseen things.

Primary Objectives:

Navigate the complex and hazardous environment of the undercity.
Achieve a specific technological goal (e.g., retrieve an item, activate a system, wipe a database).
Survive the technological and biological threats within.
Find a safe way back to the surface.
Potential Complications & Twists:

The System is Still Active: The undercity's AI is still operational and may be helpful, hostile, or insane.
Unintended Consequences: Activating one system has unforeseen and dangerous effects on another part of the complex.
A "Pristine" Environment: The undercity is perfectly preserved, but its automated defenses are fully operational and view the party as intruders.
Something Else is Down There: Another group, or a creature that has made the undercity its home, is competing with the party for resources or control.
The Exit is One-Way: The party can get in, but getting out will require them to complete a much more difficult task or find an alternate, more perilous route.
