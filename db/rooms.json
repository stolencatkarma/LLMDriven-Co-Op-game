    "description": "ðŸŒ³ **Town Square** ðŸŒ³\n\nYou stand in the heart of a bustling, friendly town. Colorful banners hang between timbered buildings, and the air is filled with the sounds of merchants hawking their wares, children laughing, and the distant clang of a blacksmith's hammer. Stalls line the cobblestone streets, offering everything from fresh produce to adventuring gear. Townsfolk greet you with warm smiles, and a large fountain bubbles cheerfully at the center of the square.",
